The dealer now hits (takes more cards) or stands depending on the value of his hand. Contrary to the player, though, the dealer's action is completely dictated by the rules. The dealer must hit if the value of their hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand. The dealer will hit a soft 17 (a hand of 17 containing an ace being counted as 11).
